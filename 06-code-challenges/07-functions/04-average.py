# Write your average function here:
def average(num1, num2):
  sum = num1 + num2
  return sum / 2

# Uncomment these function calls to test your average function:
print(average(1, 100))
# The average of 1 and 100 is 50.5
print(average(1, -1))
# The average of 1 and -1 is 0

# Codecademy's solution
def average(num1, num2):
  return (num1 + num2) / 2
